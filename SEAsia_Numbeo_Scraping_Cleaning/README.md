# SE Asia Numbeo Data Scraping and Cleaning

This folder contains a Python script and a Jupyter Notebook designed to scrape cost of living data for all Southeast Asian countries from the Numbeo website, and then clean the scraped data.

## Components

### 1. Data Scraping Script (`main.py`)

**Purpose**: This script uses the BeautifulSoup library to extract the cost of living data from Numbeo for all 11 Southeast Asia countries.

### 2. Data Cleaning Jupyter Notebook (`numbeo_data_cleaning.ipynb`)
**Purpose**: In this notebook I used Pandas library to process and clean the raw data extracted from Numbeo, ensuring it is ready for further analysis and visualization.
