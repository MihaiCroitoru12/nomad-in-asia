# Project Overview: The Ultimate Nomad’s Guide to Southeast Asia 🌏

**Goal:** 🎯
The end goal of this project is to create a web platform that will serve as a toolkit for digital nomads who want to travel to Southeast Asia. It'll have information about costs of living, rules for staying, weather, health, and safety. 💼🏝️

**What I'm Building:** 🛠️
1. **Cost of Living Calculator:** 💰 A tool where you can see how much it costs to live in different cities. 
2. **Visa and Rules Guide:** 📚 You will receive all the information about what you need to stay in these countries. 
3. **Health and Safety:** ⛑️ A map where to find hospitals, along with specific safety tips for each country. 
4. **Weather Tool:** ☀️ Provides weather forecasts and information on the best times to visit each country. 

**How I'm Doing It:** 🔍
1. **Collecting Data:** 📊 I have already collected data on the cost of living by web scraping [numbeo.com](http://www.numbeo.com) using BeautifulSoup in Python. 
2. **Cleaning and Studying Data:** 🧹 I will use various processes to ensure the data is clean and reliable for analysis. 
3. **Data Analysis:** 📈 Dig deep into the data and pull out meaningful insights. 
4. **Presenting the Findings:** 📑 Through charts, reports. 
5. **Letting Users Add Info:** ➕ In this way, the platform will be updated constantly. 
6. **Launching the Guide:** 🚀 Making it accessible for everyone. 

**The Bigger Picture:** 🖼️
In the future, I am considering adding features like personal accounts 👤, AI-based travel suggestions 💡, and a place for nomads to chat. 💬
